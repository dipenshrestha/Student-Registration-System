The Student Registration System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of recording and managing students' personal information. 
This system is beneficial for both students and school authorities, simplifying the data entry, retrieval, and management processes.
The system supports fundamental CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), allowing users to efficiently handle student records. It is built using a combination of technologies:
HTML/CSS: For creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: For interactive features and enhanced user experience.
PHP: For server-side processing and logic.
MySQL: For securely storing and managing student data in a structured database.
This system provides a simple yet effective solution for schools to maintain an organized database, reduce paperwork, and enhance operational efficiency.
